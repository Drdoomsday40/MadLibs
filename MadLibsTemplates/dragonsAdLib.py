Once upon a midnight [Word Not Submitted], \n\
while I pondered [Word Not Submitted] and [Word Not Submitted],\n\
Over many a quaint and curious [Word Not Submitted] of forgotten [Word Not Submitted],\n\
While I [Word Not Submitted], nearly napping, suddenly there came a [Word Not Submitted],\n\
As of [Word Not Submitted] gently rapping, rapping at my [Word Not Submitted] door.\n\
``Tis some [Word Not Submitted],` I muttered, `tapping at my [Word Not Submitted] door -\n\
Only this, and nothing more.`\n\
\n\
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the [Word Not Submitted] December,\n\
And each separate [Word Not Submitted] ember wrought its [Word Not Submitted] upon the floor.\n\
Eagerly I [Word Not Submitted] the morrow; - [Word Not Submitted] I had sought to borrow\n\
From my [Word Not Submitted] surcease of sorrow - \
sorrow for the [Word Not Submitted] Lenore -\n\
For the [Word Not Submitted] and [Word Not Submitted] maiden whom the angels named [Word Not Submitted] -\n\
Nameless here for evermore."
